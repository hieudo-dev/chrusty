# Chrusty

Toy browser engine written with Rust

# Motivation

Chrusty came about because I love web browsers and at the same time I wanted to dive deep into Rust programming. It's a personal project where I'm building a toy browser engine from scratch, using Rust for its efficiency and robustness.

The goal of Chrusty is to help me understand how modern web browsers work under the hood. I'm exploring everything from parsing HTML and CSS to rendering web pages. This project is a way for me to improve my skills in systems programming and learn more about browser engineering.

Hopefully after checking out this repo it inspires fellow Rust developers (or web developers) to experiment and dive deeper.

# Future ideas

- DOM:
  - Add support for more DOM node types
- CSS:
  - Add support selector combinators
